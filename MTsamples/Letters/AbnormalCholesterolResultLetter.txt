ABNORMAL CHOLESTEROL RESULT LETTER  
  
Recently you had a cholesterol test done. The cholesterol levels were
abnormal. These are usually associated with increased risk for stroke and
heart attack. I am writing this letter to you to let you know that your levels
are high enough that I think intervention is the next best step. I would like
you to make an appointment, if you are interested in treatment for this. There
are several treatment options available at this time. Diet is one of the
options, although there is limited reduction in total cholesterol and LDL
cholesterol with dieting. Most of the time under strict diet patients can
achieve a 15% reduction in cholesterol. If your cholesterol levels are
moderate to severely elevated, usually diet is not the first line of therapy.
If you are diabetic or have hypertension these two also increase your risk
with the combination of hypercholesterolemia. Most of the time cholesterol
that is elevated is from your genetic background and is independent of diet.
New research shows that treatment of high cholesterol can decrease your risk
of developing Alzheimer’s disease.  
  
Again, I am recommending at least we discuss medical treatment for
hypercholesterolemia. Please consider calling for a followup appointment
concerning your cholesterol levels. If you should have any further questions,
please do not hesitate to contact me. I am enclosing a copy of your lab
results for your review.
